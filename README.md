# CodeMedic: Automatic ICD10/CPT/Snomed code generation for clinical scenarios

Medical coding is an incredibly complex and time intensive task. While there have been previous attempts to create fully automated coding systems, we are still very far from the creation of a fully automated coding app. The following is a proof of concept for using large language models (such as GPT-3.5) as a way to automatically assign codes for clincal scenarios.  

# How it works
## Agent methodology
The following app uses LLM agents to come up with a collection of valid codes for each given clinical synopsis. The coder agent is told to play a role of a medical coder and is told to provide as many clinical codes as possible for the given scenario. Once the coder agent generates a list of code, they are passed on to the validator agent. The validator agents task is to scrutinize the code list and synopsis, making sure that all the necessary codes have been included, and removing any codes that it feels are unnecessary.


## Hallucination Checker
In order to fight against LLM hallucinations, you can choose to only include codes that have been validated in an ICD-10 database. However, as of right now the hallucination check isn't perfect, and occasionally removes valid codes from the output.


## Installation

To install this app:

Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/alexanderSolod/CodeMedic
```

Navigate into the cloned repository:

```bash
cd codemedic
```

Create a virtual environment and install the required packages:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Set up your OpenAI API key in a .env file in the root directory of the cloned repository. The file should look like this:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
```
If you do not do so, the app will request you to input your API when you try to run it.

Run the app:

```bash
gradio main.py
```
